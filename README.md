Used for codebar's [Introduction to Testing](http://codebar.github.io/tutorials/js/lesson7/tutorial.html) tutorial.

How to commit changes:

Go to the directory (ls and cd)

Go into the top level of the directory

after making change to code that you want to commit

Write the command: git commit -a (adds all the changes I have currently made) -m (for the message) "message"

eg. git commit -a -m "message"

git push (sends it to github)
