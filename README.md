In this project I use my knowledge of JavaScript to build a unit converter that allows the user to convert a selection of temperature, distance and volume.

This project was built using a TDD method using Jasmine. 

This is a project from the codebar JavaScript tutorials.

How to commit changes:

Go to the directory (ls and cd)

Go into the top level of the directory

after making change to code that you want to commit

Write the command: git commit -a (adds all the changes I have currently made) -m (for the message) "message"

eg. git commit -a -m "message"

git push (sends it to github)
